        At Sierra West Airlines, we firmly believe it is in our corporate DNA to give back to the communities we serve
        in
        an effort to make a positive impact on the world around us. This belief is embedded in our daily operations:
        including our longstanding partnerships with non-profits Wings of Rescue and Fetch Fido-a-Flight.

        Partnering with these organizations allows us to transfer small animals from overpopulated shelters to no-kill
        shelters. View our slideshow below on some of the amazing trips we have had the pleasure to be a part of. Please
        consider donating to either organization linked below to help continue their life-saving missions.
